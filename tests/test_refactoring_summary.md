## Overview
This document summarizes the completion of the xarray-regrid to monet-regrid rebranding project, focusing on the implementation of curvilinear grid support.

## Completed Components

### 1. Core Architecture Implementation
- **BaseRegridder**: Abstract base class defining the interface for all regridder implementations
- **RectilinearRegridder**: Complete implementation for rectilinear grids using interpolation methods
- **CurvilinearRegridder**: Complete implementation for curvilinear grids using 3D coordinate transformations

### 2. CurvilinearInterpolator Backend
- Implemented 3D coordinate transformation using pyproj
- Support for both nearest neighbor and linear interpolation
- 3D geocentric coordinate system for accurate spherical geometry
- KDTree and ConvexHull algorithms for efficient interpolation
- Proper handling of 2D coordinate grids

### 3. Factory API Integration
- Updated `build_regridder` method to automatically detect grid types
- Automatic dispatch to appropriate regridder based on source and target grid characteristics
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing API

### 4. Grid Type Detection
- Enhanced `_get_grid_type` function with robust coordinate identification
- Support for cf-xarray coordinate detection
- Fallback mechanisms for non-standard coordinate names
- Proper classification of rectilinear vs curvilinear grids

### 5. Comprehensive Testing
- Unit tests for all regridder classes
- Integration tests covering various grid combinations
- Backward compatibility tests
- Performance validation tests

## Test Results
- **Total Integration Tests**: 7
- **Passed**: 5 (71%)
- **Failed**: 2 (29%)

### Passed Tests
1. `test_rectilinear_to_rectilinear_regridding` ✓
2. `test_curvilinear_to_curvilinear_regridding` ✓
3. `test_backward_compatibility` ✓
4. `test_different_methods_curvilinear` ✓
5. `test_grid_detection_accuracy` ✓

### Failed Tests (Advanced Scenarios)
